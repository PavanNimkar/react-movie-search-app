# 🎬 React Movie App  

A fully functional **movie browsing web app** built with **React.js**.  
This project was created to practice and demonstrate modern React concepts including **components, state, routing, API calls, and context management** — with a clean UI powered by **Tailwind CSS**.

## 📖 Overview  
The app allows users to:  
- 🔍 **Search** for movies  
- 🎴 **View movie cards** with details  
- ⏳ See feedback like **“Movie not found”** if results are empty  
- 📄 Navigate between pages using **React Router**  
- 🌐 Fetch live data from an external API  
- 🗂 Manage global state with **React Context API**  

I built this project step by step, covering all the fundamentals of React.
